    <h1>Browser support</h1>
    <p>Adapted from <a href="https://browsersupport.clearleft.com/" aria-describedby="ext-site">ClearLeft's browser support policy</a>.</p>

    <article id="features">
      <h2>Features, not browsers</h2>
      <p>Browser support is based on capabilities of the browsers rather than their name or version. The <a href="https://web.dev/baseline">Baseline</a> initiative provides clear information about which web standards features are ready to use in websites. It designates new features into two categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Newly available: a feature is supported by the latest versions of all core browsers</li>
        <li>Widely available: a feature has been supported across browsers for at least 30 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A feature must be "widely available" to be used. A "newly available" feature may be used if it can be implemented as progressive enhancement.</p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement means missing the feature does not harm the browser or prevent access to mission-critical requirements or content. Implementing "newly available" features must be nice-to-have additions with usable degradation.</p>
    </article>

    <article id="optimize">
        <h2>Support and optimization</h2>
        <p>We support every browser and optimise for none.</p>
        <p>Support means that the core content and functionality of a website should be available to any browser. That doesn't mean the content will look exactly the same in every browser.</p>
        <p>It may also mean that every interaction may not be identical; some may be implemented as progressive enhancements in newer browsers provided the interaction isn't part of the core functionality of the website.</p>
        <p>Avoid polyfills, hacks, and workarounds that would need later removal. Follow <a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024">Interop</a> to keep abreast of features browser makers have collectively agreed to prioritize.</p>
    </article>

    <article id="access">
        <p>Two foundational principles underly this browser support policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Website content and core functionality must be accessible to everyone.</li>
            <li>It's okay for websites to look different in different browsers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Content displaying slightly differently in some browsers is a facet of the web, not a bug. This means there will sometimes be subtle visual and functional differences from browser to browser, which is acceptable provided content and core functionality are unaffected.</p>
