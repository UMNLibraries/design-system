    <h1>Files</h1>
    <div class="lead">
      <p>Published content is not presented using formats such as Google documents (and slides and spreadsheets), Microsoft documents, and PDF.</p>
      <p>Some cases may exist for other file types, but use them sparingly, always preferring HTML. Well-formatted HTML is the most accessible content delivery format.</p>

      <h2>Portable Document File (PDF)</h2>
      <p>A PDF's sole intended purposes is to retain the layout for printing, for sharing a document in a fixed state specifically for printing onto physical paper. An example might be floor plans specifically intended to be handouts.</p>
      <p>If a file is deemed to be best as a PDF, it must be formatted accessibly, which requires tagging all the content.</p>

      <h2>Google Suite</h2>
      <p>Google Suite is a set of editing tools for creating content, but not for web content distribution. It&rsquo;s set up for use as editing applications, and so puts a person into an environment that is intended for content creation. It affects the ability to navigate, and makes it unclear what their role is with the content. As a consumer, content is expected in a published format.</p>

      <h3>Google Slides</h3>
      <p>Often used for sharing presentations. Ensure <a href="https://accessibility.umn.edu/creating-accessible-content/host-inclusive-meetings-events/slide-presentations" aria-describedby="ext-site">slides are accessible</a> and consider only including them if to reference an archived event where a more accessible format isn&rsquo;t feasible.</p>

      <h3>Google Docs</h3>
      <p>In no situation are Google Docs the recommended medium for web content.</p>

      <h3>Google Sheets</h3>
      <p>When sharing large amounts of data, sheets may be a preferred method. In this case, enter the data into a digital repository such as the <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/166578" aria-describedby="ext-site">Digital Repository of the U of M (DRUM)</a> and refer to the repository entry rather than directly to the file.</p>

      <h3>Google Forms</h3>
      <p>Basic forms are moderately accessible but not preferred. Refer to <a href="/design-system/code/form.html">form guidelines</a> to create appropriate forms and determine what platform is best to capture data.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Microsoft Suite</h2>
      <p>Similar to Google suite, these formats are intended for editing. They are additionally written in proprietary software that some people may not have access to, and when converted to an open format version may not retain the layouts of the original.</p>
