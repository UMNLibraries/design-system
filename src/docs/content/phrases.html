    <h1>Terms and phrases</h1>

    <article id="jargon">
      <h2>Explain unavoidable jargon or acronyms</h2>
      <p>Define jargon or spell out acronyms the first time they appear on any page. Prior knowledge may not exist, memory may fail, or even the context by which a user arrives on the page may cause confusion.</p>

      <!--<h3>Example</h3>
      <p>American Medical Association (AMA)</p>-->

      <p>Acronyms may be presented with or without periods between each letter; the decision should be based on consistency and clarity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the acronym possible to be read as a word? (e.g. US could be read as "U.S." or "us")
          <br />If it can be interpreted like a word, use periods between the letters to ensure they are read out individually.
        </li>
        <li>Does the acronym have strongly established branding where a deviation would make it less clear? (e.g. YMCA versus Y.M.C.A. or MN versus M.N.)
          <br />For well established acronyms, present it has it is normally written.
        </li>
        <li>Is it better known by its acronym or is the expanded form fairly known as well? (e.g. JAWS versus Job Access With Speech)
          <br />Then lead with the acronym and put the expanded form inside parentheses (e.g. I.T. (information technology)).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will satisfy a web accessibility <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/abbreviations.html" aria-describedby="ext-site">success criteria for abbreviations</a>.</p>

    <article id="idioms">
      <h2>Avoid idioms, metaphors, clich&eacute;s, and colloquialisms</h2>
      <p>Idioms and cutesy or abstract turns of phrase can be difficult for English as a second language (ESL) and low literacy readers. They can be difficult or distracting to readers with cognitive impairments. And they can be inappropriate or hurtful to a person in emotional distress or crisis.</p>
      <p>Clich&eacute;s and colloquialisms are culturally oriented and often lack meaning to people outside the intended culture. They also lack the professional tone the University Libraries strive for. Particular phrases must be avoided because of underlying oppressions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307013740/https://www.businessinsider.com/offensive-phrases-that-people-still-use-2013-11" aria-describedby="ext-site">11 racist and offensive phrases that people still use all the time</a>, Business Insider (archived)</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Consider reserving "cute" for noncritical social media content or non task-based contexts like print materials or newsletters.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>&ldquo;A good rule of thumb is...&rdquo; (no.)<br />
        vs.<br />
        &ldquo;A good rule is...&rdquo; (yes.)<br />
        <em>The phrase &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; is associated with domestic violence, and adds needless complexity.</em></p>

        <p>&ldquo;That one is looking long in the tooth.&rdquo; (no.)<br />
          vs. <br />
          &ldquo;That one is looking older.&rdquo; (yes.)<br />
          <em>The phrase &ldquo;long in the tooth&rdquo; means different things in different languages, and absolutely nothing in others, in addition to adding needless complexity.</em>
