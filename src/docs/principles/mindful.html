          <dt>Discourage addictive usage</dt>
          <dd>Don't use &ldquo;Fear of Missing Out&rdquo; (FOMO) as a way to establish and maintain unhealthy addictions.</dd>
          <dd>Since addictive feedback systems are perceived as being good for business, they are deliberately designed into everyday products. While these systems are often useful in the short-term, they do not foster a positive relationship between the person and product in the long-term. Addictions are often cultivated by unpredictability &mdash; a common technique known as variable reward &mdash; where something different happens with every click. While variability and mystery can be authentic and integral parts of some products, they are capable of actively creating unhealthy and unsustainable addictions. Instead, create more manageable and predictable experiences to mitigate this problem.</dd>

          <dd><q>[...] the moment you need to make a decision about any individualâ€”the average is useless.

        <h2>Avoid anti-patterns</h2>
        <p>These are also known as &ldquo;dark patterns&rdquo;. Because of the connotation that dark equals bad or evil (such as in this case), and our anti-racism work, avoid using the word &ldquo;dark&rdquo; unless it&rsquo;s directly related to light or color.</p>

          <dd><q>A Dark Pattern is a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.</q> (Brignull, 2010)</dd>
          <dd>Anti-patterns are used to boost profits, and trick people into completing actions they didn&rsquo;t notice or mean to. Be aware of the interactions built into web assets, talk openly about their ethics, and reduce dependencies on deception.</dd>

          <dt>Technology should work even when it fails</dt>
          <dd>Think about what happens if the technology fails.</dd>
